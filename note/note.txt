scroll event intermediate server..

will be a node.js server..

vue.js? or simply.. p5/paper.js..

tween.js.. might help?

realtime capability?

what is the fastest/best way?

-

well. anyway we will simply decide to use socket.io. capability measurement should be done. but afterward. as a reference.

-

p5/paper.js.. what will be faster?

well.. what about.. sth. else. like two.js / three.js

..

what is the fastest? frontend js.

well.. also.. there's many out there. but we want sth. that can do seriously nice visual works.

maybe WEBGL help?

p5 support WEBGL.

but..well..

three.js was super fast.. for 3D stuff..

but.. than.. what about two.js?

or paper.js is slow then?

well. it says.. first do with canvas2d and then upgrade it if needed.. but don't start with webgl.

so p5 is good.

p5 can do both. so if i need any i can easily transfer.
